## Publications
### 1. A Novel Integrated Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach with Trajectory Optimization for Mining Autonomous Truck Dispatch
**Shuwei Pei** and Jue Yang. Submitted to _Resources, Conservation and Recycling_, 2023  

![Second Paper](/figure1.jpg)

In the domain of mining transportation, conventional scheduling, and human-controlled approaches often result in diminished efficiency and suboptimal outcomes, encompassing resource wastage, increased energy consumption, and safety risks. A novel open pit mining haulage simulation environment is established to facilitate dispatching operations. By integrating the Deep Q-Network (DQN), a model-free reinforcement learning system, with the dynamic programming trajectory optimization method, the efficiency of mining operations can be enhanced, thereby reducing waiting times and energy consumption. The proposed method aims to train the fleet to make more informed decisions regarding payload management, queueing time, and the number of waiting trucks. The approach is valid in the simulator several times. It results in a 10% reduction in average energy consumption for transporting one kg and a 3.8k ton increase in total production compared to the conventional fixed schedule (FS) strategy. The dispatching policy generated by the DQN algorithm demonstrates more balanced tasks between dump sites and shovel sites. It also shows robustness in handling unplanned truck failures.

Autonomous mining transportation is an intelligent traffic control system that can provide better economics than traditional transportation systems. The velocity trajectory of a manned vehicle depends on the driver‚Äôs driving style. Still, it can be optimized utilizing mathematical methods under autonomous driving conditions. This paper takes fuel and electric mining vehicles with a load capacity of 50 tons as the subject. It contributes a multi-objective optimization approach considering time, energy consumption, and battery lifetime. The dynamic programming algorithm is used to solve the optimal velocity trajectory with different optimization objectives under two types of mining condition simulation. The trajectories optimized by the single objective, energy consumption, usually adopt the pulse-and-gliding (PnG) approach frequently, which causes battery capacity loss and increases the travel time. Hence, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed. For electric vehicles, trajectories optimized by the multi-objective approach can decrease the battery capacity loss by 22.01% and the time consumption by 41.28%, leading to a 42.12% increment in energy consumption.  For fuel vehicles, it can decrease the time consumption by 32.54%, leading to a 7.68% increment in energy consumption. This velocity trajectory is smoother with less fluctuation. It can better meet the requirements of mining transportation and has a particular reference value for optimizing autonomous transportation costs in closed areas.

![Research3](/DP.png)

- In conventional manned vehicles, the overall transport cost is mainly related to the driver‚Äôs driving habits and experience. Velocity optimization of vehicles is one of the main eco-driving techniques.
- A multi-objective speed trajectory optimization method using dynamic programming was proposed considering travel time, energy consumption, and battery lifetime. And it is verified on the fuel and electric vehicle models.
- The results spend less time and it runs with less velocity fluctuations. Moreover, it can reduce battery capacity loss, which prolongs the battery‚Äôs lifetime for electric vehicles. It will adopt different frequencies of PnG approach as the gradient of routes changes.
- However, it leads to an increment in energy consumption. It is a kind of Pareto optimal trade-off.
