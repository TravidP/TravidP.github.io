# Personal information

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Shuwei Pei
#### Applying a PhD
I am highly devoted to the automobile industry and intensely interested in autonomous robotics. I have a strong sense of responsibility and extraordinary ability of team communication and cooperation, thus able to get along well with other members in a team. I am good at analyzing, thinking and summarizing, and can therefore get used to new fields easily. With the experience as an exchange student for half a year, I can communicate with people in English fluently.
